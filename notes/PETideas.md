## Time resolution  
80 MHz laser fires every 12.5 ns  
1 kM of fiber will do the wavelength to time stretching  
this induces 5 microseconds of delay for the spectral readout  

So for now, let's consider using the split off light as a trigger source  
that will be read out with an amplified photodiode  
That diode will then trigger the camera to read the frame for the corresponding 5 microsecond delayed ???
